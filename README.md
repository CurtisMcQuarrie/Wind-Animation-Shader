# Wind-Animation-Shader
A project for my Graphics 2 class that creates a realistic animation for vegetation in response to a wind force.
## Notes
The project was originally developed on GitLab, but I am providing the zip file of the latest build for those that want to view  it.

The solution to be ran may be found in the "opengl-2022" folder.
